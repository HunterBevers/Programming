        <div id="Rules">Rules: If you manage to generate the number eight 888,888 times you will not die alone like a loser
            because if you put 8 on it's side it stands for infinity, and you must get 888,888 because three is the magic number
            for Illuminati and theres two sets of three which symbolizes you and your partner. So if you want to create eternal magic between you and your true love, then I would highly recommend
            you stop eating Doritos, put that Mountain Dew down, get off of Twitch and go find her. I promise generating the number
            eight 888,888 times will work, you can always trust Trollface.
